# Tech Check

**Tech Check** is a single page flask application I built for my soccer team at WPI for our weekly check ins we call "tech checks." This project is built using Python and Flask for the backend, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and JSON for persistent data storage.

## What is a Tech Check?

A tech check is something you share with the team that is a good thing that happened to you during the week or something you are looking forward to. There are 2 rules to tech checks. The first is that everyone has to and gets to share something. The second is that your tech check can't be about food or sleep. 

## Features

- Users can post their tech checks to keep the team informed.
- The most recent posts appear at the top of the post list.
- Persistent storage of posts in a JSON file, allowing posts to remain available across sessions.
- A full-width header and centered content for a clean, user-friendly interface.
